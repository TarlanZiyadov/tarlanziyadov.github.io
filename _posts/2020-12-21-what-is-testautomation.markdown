## **What Does "Test" Mean?**

You may read about _QA_, _Tester_, _Test Engineer_ and so on.  
Those persons may test software or hardware depending on how the product looks or feels like.

But it's not necessarily a product you must interact with —  
perhaps asking a question may be a part of testing in order to verify your thoughts or requirements —  
that the product may have implemented or not.

In some cases it **will** be implemented in further development — it depends on the situation.

---

Testing can be **subjective** — every tester might think, feel, and understand differently as a human being.

You may have heard or read about **Test Automation Engineer**, or **automated testing**, and so on.  
You can find many different names for different testing roles.

---

As I tried to explain briefly — I mean _very_ briefly —  
testing is a huge field in IT, and many books have been written about it.

So I recommend reading some of them to at least understand:

- Who is a tester?
- What does a tester do?
- How can testing be done?

_Google can help you start._  
(And maybe in some future blog post I’ll share books or articles I’ve read.)

## **Knowing the Answer Before Asking the Question**

As I said in the beginning of this blog, asking a question to verify a requirement can be a part of testing.  
In this case, as a tester, you don't know the answer before you ask the question.

But as a **Test Automation Engineer**, you **know the answer** before you ask the question.

---

Sounds weird, right?  
Because you want to get the answer you already know — you know which question to ask.

The difference is: as a Test Automation Engineer, you're questioning a **product**, not a **human being**.  
A product that doesn't talk the language we use — it only understands programming languages.

---

Since you know the answers, it's not a question anymore — it's **checking**.

When you already know the answer, why ask a product that can't think like a human?  
You can save time and act instead — by checking the answers.

Automating the answers by checking them is what we call **Test Automation**.

---

But it's not as simple as it sounds.

First, you have to choose which answers you want to get.  
Then ask yourself:

- Do those answers exist in the product?
- If not, **should** they exist?

---

As you see, you need to know the product well **before** you can check anything.  
That means the product must be ready for checking,  
and it must already contain the answers you’ll expect later in your checks or automated tests.

---

### **Why is it called Test Automation?**

Because you will be checking **many answers**,  
and those answers will expand over time.

You want to make sure that you still get the **same answer** to your **first question**,  
even when there are 1,000 other answers added later.

---

Since this blog is about **Test Automation** — not technical testing —  
I'll explain how to get started with automation in the **next blog**.

---

Of course, these are just **my personal thoughts**,  
and they may not be the same as yours — or how you see Test Automation.
